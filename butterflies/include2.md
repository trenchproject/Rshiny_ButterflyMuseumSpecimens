## Study variables
Our dataset will allow you to explore the following variables:
Year

Day of year

Wing coloration [will find pictures]: degree of wing melanism on the posterior ventral hind-wing within a triangulated region between the eyespot, hind wing insertion, and the wing margin [34,35]. Wing scales are pigmented by either melanin (dark) or pterin (light). We calculated a gray level value between 0 (white) and 1 (black), which reflects the proportion of melanic scales. 

Forewing length, proxy for overall body size [drop?]: Cooler temperatures tend to delay development and cause insects to grow bigger. Bigger sizes may also help retain heat.

Fur thickness: We measured setal length directly on the ventral thorax with an ocular micrometer on a Wild M5 microscope as the longest setae between the first and second leg. 

Pupal temperatures: Based on previous studies in the closely related Colias eriphyle [21], we predicted that Tp might alter wing melanism via plasticity. We expect Td (encompassing late larval and pupal development) to influence phenology and forewing length, a proxy for body size [37]. Pupation lasts for 14 days at 20Â°C for the closely related C eriphyle [13]. Slightly expanding the window to account for uncertainty in this duration, we estimated Tp as the average of mean daily temperatures 26 to 6 days prior to the collection date.

Seasonal (developmental) temperatures: We further expanded the window to include late larval development and estimated Td as the average of mean daily temperatures 46 days to 6 days prior to the mean flight date (day 208, i.e., days 162 to 202). We used fixed dates to estimate Td to indicate annual conditions and avoid circularity in predicting phenology. 

## Hypothesis generation
Potential hypotheses: 1) temperatures during the development period have increased, reflecting regional climate warming; 2) warmer developmental temperatures have advanced adult phenology; and 3) thermoregulatory trait values have declined to reduce the heat load associated with warming. However, these declines may be lessened if phenological shifts enable temperature tracking. We then examine how phenology, temperature, and year interact to influence thermoregulatory traits. In particular, we look for evidence that higher pupal temperatures decrease melanism via plasticity.
