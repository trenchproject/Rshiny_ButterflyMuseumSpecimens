## Historic specimens
Using museum specimens to examine morphology:
Most evidence for organismal responses to climate change consists of shifts in phenology, distribution, and abundance [1]. However, some studies have shown that species’ morphologies are also shifting in response to climate change. These studies are often limited to exploring shifts in body size [2,3], and whether body size shifts are driven by plasticity or evolution is often unknown. Museum specimens represent a largely untapped resource for detecting shifts in functional phenotypes beyond size [4,5]. 

## Intro to Colias butterflies
Climate change influences organisms at two timescales.
Long-term conditions aggregate to determine energy balance and subsequently reproduction
Short-term climate extremes can cause thermal stress and mortality
The balance of these two impacts varies across environmental and elevation gradients but is difficult to quantify.

Colias butterflies, known as sulphurs or clouded yellows, on mountains allow exploring the issue because traits that determine body temperatures set the balance of these impacts.  Colias body temperatures are influenced by two key thermoregulatory traits: 1) more dark pigments on the underside of their wings allows the butterflies to heat up by absorbing more solar radiation, and 2) longer hairs (fur) of their body insulate from heat loss.

The butterflies are ecotherms and only able to fly over a narrow range of body temperatures, so body temperatures determine the duration of flight. Flight is required for activities including mating, feeding, and oviposition that influence fitness. However, butterflies may overheat, which not only limits flight time, but can also directly reduce the number of viable eggs produced by each female. 

Butterflies at higher elevations have darker wings which allows them to warm up in cool temperatures. Despite the generally cool temperatures, high levels of solar radiation at high elevations pose an overheating risk. Overheating does not seem to be much of a problem for high elevation butterflies in current conditions, but overheating could become a problem as climates change. 

Wing coloration is determined by genetics and potentially also plasticity: increased temperatures during pupal development lead to lighter wings to avoid overheating. [We don’t actually know how plastic the high elevation Colias meadii is since we can’t rear them. Our plasticity data is for slightly lower elevation C. eriphlye, so perhaps we should pose plasticity as a possibility.]


Wing coloration is a rare trait in that it is observable in museum specimens, links directly to butterfly physiology, and determines responses to both short- and long-term thermal stress.

In this activity, we will use museum specimens of the high elevation Colias meadii to explore whether wing coloration and other thermoregulatory traits have over recent decades as climate change has increased temperatures.

The simplest prediction is that wings have become lighter to avoid overheating as the climate has warmed. However, the researchers built models of how the butterflies’ environment influences their body temperatures, flight times, and how flight times influences rates of survival and reproduction. The models support the simple prediction of wing lightening at lower elevations. At high elevations where conditions are cold, the models predict that darker wings could allow the butterflies to fly over more areas and longer durations both through the day and across the season. However, the darker wings would also increasing overheating risk when temperatures are warm and solar radiation levels are high. 

[Section complicated. Reduce or drop?]
Other complications make predictions challenging. Variable environmental conditions at high altitude may cause variability in whether light or dark wings confer greater fitness and slow down evolution. Plasticity may also allow butterflies to respond to respond to environmental variability. This response could either slow evolution by providing an alternative response or facilitate evolution by reducing variation in selection. Butterflies may also develop faster in warm temperatures, leading to earlier phenology and exposure to cool, early-season conditions.

## Specimens
Colias meadii occurs in subalpine and alpine meadows above 2.5km elevation throughout the Rocky Mountains from northern New Mexico, USA to southern Alberta, Canada [23]. They have a single generation each year (univoltine) and diapause over the winter as 3rd instar larvae; the adult flight season lasts four to six weeks in July and August (between days 180-240). Individual butterflies live only a few days and the flight season in any particular location is limited to several weeks, but the timing of the flight season can differ among locations. 

Graduate student Heidi MacLean visited seven museums across the United States to collect data from butterfly specimens collected from 1953 50 2013 in  three regions (Southern RM= Southern Rocky Mountains; Northern RM= Northern Rocky Mountains; and Canadian RM= Canadian Rocky Mountains, Figure 1).  We analyze the regions separately because they are genetically distinguished with clear evidence of restricted gene flow between all three regions [31]. 
Weather is variable in the mountains and historic weather data from high elevation is limited, so we selected a representative weather station that occupies a high, relevant elevation for each region. 
[Link to pictures of weather stations?: For the Southern and Northern RM, we used stations from the National Weather Service Cooperative Observed Program (COOP) at Climax, CO (39.37°N, 106.18°W, 3514m) and Moran 5WNW, WY (43.86°N, 110.59°W, 2072m), respectively (data retrieved from www.ncdc.noaa.gov). For the Canadian RM, we used the Blue Hill Lookout, Alberta station (51.70°N, 115.22°W, 1951m, data retrieved from http://climate.weather.gc.ca). ]
The highest station with complete weather data was below butterfly habitat in the Northern Rocky Mountains, so we used abiatic lapse rate (as average of how fast temperatures cool as you move up a mountain) to adjust the weather station temperatures.
