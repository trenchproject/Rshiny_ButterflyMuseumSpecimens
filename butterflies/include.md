## Morphological Responses to Climate Change: A Case Study

### Museum specimens hold clues to organisms' physical changes 

In different environments, different physical forms are more or less suitable. For instance, trees growing in extremely windy places tend to have stout trunks and be short in stature, both traits that make them less susceptible to wind damage. It makes sense, then, that climate change is leading to changes in organisms’ physical structure, or morphology. One thing researchers have documented in many species is a [shrinking of overall body size](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-global-warming-is-shrinking-earths-animals/). There are a few reasons for this, but one is that it’s easier to cool yourself down if you’re smaller, since you have a larger surface area compared to your volume. Think of how much faster a hot cup of coffee cools down if you pour it into a wide pan! Another reason that’s specific to insects and other ectotherms is that when it’s warm, insects grow to adulthood more quickly—and therefore reach adulthood at a smaller size.

Is climate change driving other types of morphological shifts? To answer this question, it’s useful to look to museums, which often hold many individuals of the same species that have been collected over a long period of time, allowing us to compare later specimens to earlier ones and look for patterns. In this case study, you’ll be able to examine data from museum specimens of montane butterflies in the genus *Colias*.

### Warmth is life or death for *Colias* butterflies

Because almost all have wings that are a shade of yellow—ranging from very pale cream to a rich egg-yolk orange—*Colias* butterflies are known as “Sulphurs” in North America. (They are often called “Clouded Yellows” in other parts of the world.) Many of these lovely insects inhabit mountains, where temperatures can vary widely over the course of a single day and across a butterfly’s lifespan. **Thermoregulation**—maintaining an ideal body temperature—is therefore incredibly important to butterfly survival and reproduction in these environments. If they’re too cold, butterflies can’t fly, feed, mate, or lay eggs. So *Colias* butterflies have developed traits that help them thermoregulate. Primarily, dark pigmentation on the undersides of their wings helps them absorb solar radiation when they need to warm up.

Exactly how dark an individual butterfly’s wings end up being depends on the genes it has evolved to carry and on plasticity (non-genetic responses to the environment). Butterfly species that live in cool environments, like high-elevation mountain meadows, tend to have darker wings. But some species are also known to be plastic. For them, an individual’s wing color depends also on the temperature it experienced as a pupa. This adds flexibility to butterfly morphology, allowing them to handle seasons that may be warmer or cooler than usual. (Some butterflies have multiple generations in a season, and plasticity can even allow these species to handle big temperature changes across a season!) As a rule, cooler pupal temperatures lead to more wing darkening, and vice versa. 

High elevations can be extremely sunny, and it’s possible for butterflies to get too hot to fly. Overheating is also detrimental because it means females lay fewer high quality eggs. For most of the evolutionary history of these insects, overheating hasn’t been much of a problem for high elevation butterflies—but their story might be different under climate change. Wing coloration is an interesting trait to study in relation to climate change because it has direct impacts on an individual’s survival and reproduction, and it’s easy to measure in museum specimens. If the places where *Colias* butterflies live have warmed in recent decades, we might expect that more recent specimens will have lighter wings that are less vulnerable to overheating than older ones.  

### Pulling data out of specimen drawers

The data you’ll be exploring today were collected by graduate student Heidi MacLean from seven different museums across the United States. She focused on tracking down examples of *Colias meadii*, also known as Mead’s Sulphurs. These butterflies are found in subalpine and alpine meadows in the Rocky Mountain range, from northern New Mexico in the U.S. to southern Alberta in Canada. Each year, eggs laid in summer develop through three larval instars (stages) before going into their winter diapause. In the spring, the larvae come out of diapause and continue to feed and develop until they pupate. Finally, they emerge as adults in July and August. Individual adult butterflies have only a few days to reproduce before they die. Altogether, MacLean found a total of 861 *Colias meadii* specimens that had been collected between 1953 and 2013, from three different populations that are known to be genetically distinct.

You can see below where each population is found and the elevation at which it lives. Butterflies at higher latitudes live at lower elevations, which allows all populations to occupy a similar range of temperatures. You can also see how spring and summer temperatures have increased over time in each region (although note how much each line jumps around—that’s a sign of high variation!). By the way, the climate data below come from nearby weather stations in each region. There was no weather station with a complete historical record located as high up in the mountains as butterflies live in the Northern Rocky Mountains, but knowing the rate at which temperatures cool as you move up a mountain, researchers were able to adjust the data from the nearest station to come up with an approximation of the correct climate.
