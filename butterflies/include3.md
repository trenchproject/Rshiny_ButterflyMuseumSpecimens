Try to answer some of the following questions by changing the data you plot. For each question, consider whether you see the same patterns at all three sites, or if different populations respond differently. Recall how each population occupies a different elevational range. How might this affect their responses? Click the hint buttons for some help.

2. Have butterfly wings lightened over the years? [hint 2](#hint2)

3. Have forewings or setae length decreased over the years? [hint 3](#hint3)

4. Do spring and summer temperatures affect the day of year when butterflies reach adulthood? [hint 4](#hint4)
